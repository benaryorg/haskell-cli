If you feel capable of writing code for this project, feel free to do so.
You can then either send it to me personally or submit a pull request.
Someone might at some point review your work.

Just stick to the coding style in the present code and you'll be fine.
You can also use a different coding style.
Don't expect a rewrite/reformat of the whole codebase though.
