It feels humiliating just to need to write this text.
Just be nice to each other, have some basic decency.

If someone feels hurt or insulted by what you said, then please think about
what you've said and what might be wrong with that.

Apologise and go on.
Things like those happen.
Just try not no make the same mistake again.
